# Flyte Governance 

This document defines the governance structure for the Flyte project.

## Overview
Flyte, a graduated LF AI&Data Foundation project, is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community focused on building a scalable and resillient platform for Machine Learning and Data Processing workloads. This document aims to define how community should work together to achieve this goal.


## Community roles and path to maintainership:

The following table lists the roles we use within the Flyte community. The table describes:

- General responsibilities expected by individuals in each role
- Requirements necessary to join or stay in a given role
- How the role manifests in terms of permissions and privileges.

## Expanded description and processes

### Community participant
You do not need to be a member of the Flyte team to help. Anyone can help by using and talking about Flyte, participating in discussions, answering questions on Slack/Stack Overflow, opening issues, submitting PRs, etc. All of these are fantastic and welcome contributions to the community.

### Contributor
Contributors are those who make regular contributions to the project (documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.). 

New contributors may be self-nominated or nominated by existing contributors, and must be elected by a [supermajority](#supermajority) of that projectâ€™s maintainers. Contributors may review and approve PRs (non-binding), merge approved PRs, and create branches.

### Maintainers
Maintainers are in charge of the day to day maintenance of the team's projects.

They review and approve (binding) PRs, merge PRs, and may cast non-binding votes on RFCs, ensuring contributions align with project goals and meet the project's quality standards.

New maintainers must already be contributors, must be nominated by an existing maintainer, and must be elected by a supermajority of the current team's maintainers. Likewise, maintainers can be removed by a supermajority of the current team's maintainers or can resign by notifying one of the current team's maintainers.

In extenuating circumstances, i.e. long term absence of a maintainer, steering committee members may act as maintainers.

### Steering Committee
The Steering Committee Members are responsible for the direction of the project (roadmap), and cross-cutting concerns such as:
- Reviewing and deciding on new projects to add to Flyte
- Voting on role changes (eg adding new Steering Committee member)
- Voting on updating this document
- Voting on RFCs that impact any of the above responsibilities.

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process
If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.

## Definitions

### Supermajority
A supermajority is defined as two-thirds of members in the group (66%). A supermajority of Maintainers is required for certain decisions as outlined above. Voting on decisions can happen on the mailing list, GitHub, Slack, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. Maintainers can either vote "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes when supermajority is met. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.
