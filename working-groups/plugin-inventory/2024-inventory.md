# Introduction

This is the main deliverable of the Plugin Inventory WG.
You are encouraged to contribute to this list by:

-  Confirming the status of one or more plugins that you're using ("does it work?")
- Adding notes on what elements you see missing (even if the integration is working for you)

## Why?

Flyte is a platform only to the extent it is extensible. Also, it's on the interest of the community to rely on a robust ecosystem of integrations. This assessment is a first step towards finding possible issues on particular integrations and eventually allocate resources to fix them.
