* Guest presentation (show & tell)
    * Authz on Flyte (lighting talk) - **David Espejo**
        * PR to update auth docs: https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/3837
    * Daft: the distributed Python dataframe for complex data - **Jay Chia, Eventual.inc co-founder and daft maintainer**
        * Daft performance benchmarks: https://blog.getdaft.io/p/introducing-daft-a-high-performance
        * Notes: Jay presented about the Python distributed data frame library called daft, which aimed to handle complex data types like images and tensors. He discussed the challenges of working with multimodal data and the need to combine ML algorithms, Python code, and SQL relational operations for effective data engineering. Jay discussed the challenges of maintaining separate systems for handling different types of data and the benefits of using a solution like DAFT, which allows for efficient processing of both relational and complex data types. He also mentioned the advantages of using Flyte in conjunction with DAFT for scalable and reproducible data processing workflows. Jay discussed the capabilities of Daft, a data frame library, including filtering data, working with complex data like images, and running Python functions. He also mentioned the use of Flyte, a workflow engine, to create reproducible pipelines and orchestrate data processing tasks. Jay discussed the integration of Flyte tasks using Ray and mentioned the possibility of passing data frames between steps for more efficient processing. Jeev and David expressed interest in understanding the implementation of lazy serialization and passing of unmaterialized frames between tasks
