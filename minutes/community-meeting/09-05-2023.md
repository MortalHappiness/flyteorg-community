      * **Flyte journey at Cradle (Eli Bixby)**
        * Notes: Eli discussed the mission of their company, which is to make programming biology easy by using machine learning to improve proteins and enzymes. They also mentioned their unique usage of Flyte in their production loop, where they trained and updated models based on new data from customers.
Eli and John discussed the positive aspects of the Flyte workflow system, including its provision of reproducibility, provenance, and caching. They also mentioned using weights and biases for storing artifacts and expressed a desire for more tagging and filtering options for provenance.

The team discussed the challenges of composing workflows and encouraging good code practices. They implemented a multi-package Python monorepo approach to handle dependencies and ensure separate Python environments for development.

The discussion revolved around addressing issues related to dependencies, versioning, and workflow composition in a development environment. They explored solutions such as separate Python environments, tagging versions, and making workflow execution serializable to improve the overall workflow management process.

Eli and Ketan discussed various improvements and challenges in using Flyte. Eli mentioned the need for more granular permissions, better execution fetching, data deletion, improved mapping and streaming capabilities, and support for higher-order functions to avoid a combinatorial explosion of registered workflows.
Ketan and Eli discussed the possibility of solving a problem using task templates, but they also acknowledged that the requirement of interfaces could complicate the solution. They ran out of time to share more details but expressed interest in exploring the topic further in the future.
