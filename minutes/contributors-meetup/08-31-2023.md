* Minutes:  
The team discussed an experiment they conducted to implement a minimal change in propeller to address user confusion regarding retries. They found that the implementation resolved most cases and made a small PR to adapt the one case where it didn't, awaiting feedback from customers and Eduardo.

The team discussed the behavior of retries and attempts in the system. They debated whether to switch to a non-interruptible behavior for the last system failure and considered introducing a negative number configuration value for the last retry.

David discussed updates on working groups and proposals, but there were no significant comments or new ideas. Fabio introduced a new bot in the flag repo to label and close stale issues, and also discussed the GCP identity hour proxy initiative, which aims to enhance security by allowing only authenticated requests to reach the back end.

Fabio and Haytham discussed the authentication setup for integrating a proxy with the flyteadmin. They explored different options, including using ID tokens and proxy authorization headers, and discussed the possibility of extending the authentication mechanism to other proxies in the future.

Haytham asked about the dependency on Google libraries in a command. Fabio explained that the command uses a standard OAuth2 flow with a dependency on a Google library, but it is only added to the specific plugin and not to the main flyteKit. They agreed to discuss further offline or in the next meeting
